features:
  - Added a new config option ``nova_keypair`` to specify an existing Nova
    keypair name for the database instance creation, the cloud administrator is
    responsible for the keypair management and configuration. It's recommended
    to create Trove database instance in the admin project for security
    reasons, so only the cloud administrator who has the private key can access
    the database instance. With the keypair support, ssh keys are no longer
    injected into Trove guest agent image at build time.
upgrade:
  - Cloud administrator needs to create a Nova keypair and specify the keypair
    name for config option ``nova_keypair``, the private key is used to ssh
    into new database instances created. The previous private key is also
    needed to ssh into the existing database instances.
